the process is very similar in every application

01)validate data contained in the request = pipe
02)make sure the author is authenticated = guard
03)route the request to a particular function = controller
04)run some business logic = service
05)access a DB = repository

parts of nest
-----------------------------------------------

01)controller = handles incoming request
02)services = handles data access and business logic
03)modules = groups together code
04)pipes = validates incoming data
05)filters = handles errors that occur during request handling
06)guards = handles authentication
07)interceptors = ads extra logic to incoming request or outgoing responses
08)repository = handles data stores ina DB

validating request data with pipes
----------------------------------------------------

01)@Param('id') = for /:id
02)@Query()
03)@Headers = host -> localhost:3000/  content-type:application/json
04)@Body

setting up automatic validation
---------------------------------------------------

01)tell nest to use global validation
02)create a class that describes the different properties that the request body should have
03)add validation rules to the class
04)apply that class to the request header
